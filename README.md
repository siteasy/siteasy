# About siteasy
When I want to build a web to introduce the 6502 CPU, I want to build a website. I tried Jeklly, Hexo and Hugo. But they are still so hard to understand and customize. So I build this tool. 
It is very simple and easy to understand. 
- put all articles in the directory articles
- Each folder in the directory articles make an category
- You can specify more category even you don't have the folder in the directory articles. This feature let you put an link to outside
